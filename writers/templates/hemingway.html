<h1>Ernest Miller Hemingway </h1>
<h3>Ernest Miller Hemingway (July 21, 1899 â€“ July 2, 1961) was an American novelist, short-story writer and journalist. 
    Known for an economical, understated style that influenced later 20th-century writers, he has been romanticized 
    for his adventurous lifestyle and outspoken, blunt public image. Some of his seven novels, six short-story collections 
    and two non-fiction works have become classics of American literature, and he was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in Literature.</h3>
